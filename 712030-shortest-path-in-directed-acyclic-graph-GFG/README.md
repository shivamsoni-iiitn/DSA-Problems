# [Shortest Path in Directed Acyclic Graph](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/shortest-path-in-directed-acyclic-graph/1)
## Medium
Given a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with V vertices numbered from 0 to V - 1 and E weighted directed edges represented by a 2D array edges[][], where edges[i] = [u, v, wt] denotes a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v with weight wt, find the shortest distance from the source vertex 0 to every other vertex.
Return an array of size V, where the i-th element represents the shortest distance from the source vertex 0 to vertex i. If a vertex is not reachable from the source, return -1 for that vertex.
Examples :
Input: V = 4, edges = [[0,1,2], [0,2,1]]
Output: [0, 2, 1, -1]Explanation: Shortest path from 0 to 1 is 0-&gt;1 with edge weight 2. Shortest path from 0 to 2 is 0-&gt;2 with edge weight 1. There is no way we can reach 3, so it's -1 for 3.
Input: V = 6, edges = [[0,1,2], [0,4,1], [4,5,4], [4,2,2], [1,2,3], [2,3,6], [5,3,1]]
Output: [0, 2, 3, 6, 1, 5]Explanation: Shortest path from 0 to 1 is 0-&gt;1 with edge weight 2. Shortest path from 0 to 2 is 0-&gt;4-&gt;2 with edge weight 1+2=3. Shortest path from 0 to 3 is 0-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;3 with edge weight 1+4+1=6. Shortest path from 0 to 4 is 0-&gt;4 with edge weight 1.Shortest path from 0 to 5 is 0-&gt;4-&gt;5 with edge weight 1+4=5.
